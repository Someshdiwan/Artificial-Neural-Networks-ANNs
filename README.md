# Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) Implementations

This repository contains practical implementations of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) using Python. The focus of this project is on demonstrating the basic concepts and applications of ANNs, particularly in logic gate simulations, such as XOR, AND, OR, and NOT gates. The implementations use different architectures like **Feedforward Neural Networks** and **Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP)** with backpropagation and perceptron learning methods.

## üöÄ Overview

Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are a class of machine learning algorithms inspired by the human brain's structure and functioning. ANNs are widely used in various applications like image recognition, natural language processing, and logic-based decision-making.

This repository showcases fundamental ANN techniques and implementations for **logic gate simulations** and **perceptron models**.

### Key Implementations:

- **XOR Gate Using Backpropagation**: A neural network model for learning the XOR logic gate using backpropagation in a multilayered perceptron (MLP).
- **XOR Gate Using Feedforward MLP**: Implementing XOR logic gate simulation using a feedforward multilayered perceptron.
- **AND, OR, and NOT Gates**: Perceptron implementations to simulate logical AND, OR, and NOT gates.
- **Multiple Methods**: Various techniques to implement the same gates, demonstrating different approaches to neural network design and training.
