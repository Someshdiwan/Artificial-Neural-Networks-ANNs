# Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) Implementations

This repository contains practical implementations of **Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)** using Python. The primary focus is on demonstrating core ANN concepts and applications, especially in **logic gate simulations** such as **XOR**, **AND**, **OR**, and **NOT** gates. The repository includes implementations using architectures like **Feedforward Neural Networks** and **Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP)**, employing methods such as **backpropagation** and **perceptron learning**.

## üöÄ Overview

**Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)** are computational models inspired by the biological neural networks in the human brain. ANNs are widely used in applications such as **image recognition**, **natural language processing**, and **decision-making tasks**. 

In this repository, we focus on **logic gate simulations** using ANNs, specifically implementing **XOR**, **AND**, **OR**, and **NOT** gates with different neural network architectures.

Key implementations include:

- **XOR Gate Using Backpropagation**: A model for learning the XOR logic gate using backpropagation in a multilayered perceptron (MLP).
- **XOR Gate Using Feedforward MLP**: Simulation of the XOR gate using a feedforward multilayered perceptron.
- **AND, OR, and NOT Gates**: Perceptron models to simulate logical **AND**, **OR**, and **NOT** gates.
- **Multiple Techniques**: Different approaches to neural network design for gate simulation.
