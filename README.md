## 🚀 Overview

Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are a class of machine learning algorithms inspired by the human brain's structure and functioning. ANNs are widely used in various applications like image recognition, natural language processing, and logic-based decision-making.

This repository showcases fundamental ANN techniques and implementations for **logic gate simulations** and **perceptron models**.

### Key Implementations:

- **XOR Gate Using Backpropagation**: A neural network model for learning the XOR logic gate using backpropagation in a multilayered perceptron (MLP).
- **XOR Gate Using Feedforward MLP**: Implementing XOR logic gate simulation using a feedforward multilayered perceptron.
- **AND, OR, and NOT Gates**: Perceptron implementations to simulate logical AND, OR, and NOT gates.
- **Multiple Methods**: Various techniques to implement the same gates, demonstrating different approaches to neural network design and training.
